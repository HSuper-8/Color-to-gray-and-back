# Color2Gray-andBack

## Description
This Program was created to replicate the results achieved by Ricardo L. de Queiroz and Karen M. Braun in their paper "Color to Gray and Back:Color Embedding Into Textured Gray Images". The objective of this software was to insert the color information of a colored image inside its gray-scale format by using wavelet transform in order that we can recover the color afterwards.
